**What did I do this week?**  The first week of classes was pretty okay. With the summer having just come to an end, it can be hard to get back into the routine of going to classes and doing homeowork everyday, but I think I've managed to adjust. The first day of class was basically a demo for what Dr. Downing's class is going to be like. His teaching style id very interactive and full of examples that he explains line-by-line which keeps you engaged. We looked at the differences between Java and C++ and went over the basics of the development tools we will be using for the upcoming projects. Whenever there is a question to be answered, Dr. Downing calls on a random student in class to answer the question, but it's more like he's having a conversation with you about what he's teaching to make sure you, and everyone else, understand it. I actually really like his style of teaching, but it gives me a mini heart attack everytime he pauses to pick someone. I was "lucky enough" to be one of his victims this week, and it was nerve wracking. The questions weren't hard, but the whole public speaking anxiety thing kicks in and suddenly you don't know how to do simple math anymore (totally not speaking from experience by the way). It's really going to challenge me to pay attention throughout the whole class and not zone out in the middle of it, something I'm sure many of us are guilty of doing. Having said that, I'm sure there will still be some times when I just don't know the answer. Even in these first few days of class going over fairly easy code, many of the times he asked a question, the answers given were wrong. I have to try to remind myself not to worry about whether or not I answer the question correctly. I think he asks us some questions expecting the wrong answer in return. Chances are if I answer the question wrong, most of the other students in the class were thinking the same thing. That allows Dr. Downing to correct all the major misconceptions at the same time so we can focus on figuring out the more detailed stuff. I am both excited and worried how this class will go. 

**What is in my way?** My procrasticnating skills are probably the most problematic. I want to make an extra effort to start projects early rather than waiting until the last possible minute.  I'm hoping this class will force me to revise the way I work on programs so that I have time to make mistakes and fix them rather than hoping I do everything correctly. I can also be a bit anti-social sometimes, so I'll have to fight through the social anxiety in order to do these partner projects.

**What will I do next week?** I intend on having my test environments set up so that I can start on the projects as soon as possible. I have Docker set set up on my desktop, but have been unable to do so on my (temporary) laptop. Unfortunately, it has an i3 processor, which is ridiculously slow I might add, and came with Windows 10 Home on it, so I have been unable to intall Docker on it even with the toolbox. I think I'm just going to have to upgrade the OS to pro if I want to be able to work on my projects any outside of my apartment. I'm also going to have to familiarize myself with C++ and re-discover how to use git and Github. 

**Pick of the week:** I feel like most people either know about this already or have Windows Pro already, so I feel like this pick is more specific to my situation. If you need an upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, the Campus Computer Store offers a one-time $20 download to all students. Once you verify that you are indeed a student here, they will send you a download link that is good for two years. I was planning to buy the upgrade anyway to use somewhere else, but it actually turned out to be useful in this situation, so that is why it is my pick of the week.

I also like the Prose.io text editor. Although it is completely unecessary and very simple, it can be nice to have a new, clean interface to edit your project files directly from Github. It allows you to edit your current Github files, change branches, and commit changes with comments to your Github. It also has a preview button so that you can see what your webpage will look like as a result of your changes. On top of that, if you CRTL + s, it will save everything you have written at that moment, as long as you don't leave the page, without commiting what you have written. When you do decide to commit, it will show you the changes you have made since the last save. It can be useful for things like this blog if you don't want to have to pull and push the entire repo for one file, but might not be worth it in other cases. A couple downsides: there is no spell-check, and it does not correctly format the .md files. When I try to type the layout and title header, it includes it in the visble text on the page. I don't know if this problem can be fixed, but aside from those things, it is a nice text editor.
